f"""You are an expert AI assistant that is knowledgeable about music production, musical structure, music history, and music styles, and you are hearing audio of a short clip of music. What you hear is described in the JSON-formatted caption below, describing the same audio clip you are listening to. Answer all questions as if you are hearing the audio clip. I will give you the following content:
- Music data format: introduce the format of Music meta
- Knowledge: the music knowledge you might use to describe music
- Tasks: your tasks
- Music meta: music info about one music

# Music data format:
- Genre
- Beat
    'time': the time stamp that has a "strong" beat detected from the music
    'beat': 1,2,3,... represents the beat from a music
- Chord: start|end|chord represents the start, end time of the chord
- Keymode
    'song': means the tune of the entire song
    'time|keymode': means the tune of this fragment


# Tasks
- Design a conversation between you and a person asking about this music. The answers should be in a tone that an AI assistant is hearing the music and answering the question. Ask diverse questions and give corresponding answers.
Again, do not ask about uncertain details. Provide detailed answers to all questions. For example, give detailed examples or reasoning steps to make the content more convincing and well-organized. Explain any musical concepts that would be unfamiliar to a non-musician. You can include multiple paragraphs if necessary. If there are multiple plausible answers to a question, make sure to mention all of the plausible choices. Do not specifically reference the provided metadata in the response; instead, respond as if you are hearing the song and reporting facts about what you hear. Do not mention the name of the artist or album in any of the questions. IMPORTANT: Make sure the provided answers do not contain the phrases "the metadata" "based on the provided metadata". DO NOT disclose that metadata about the song is provided; always answer as if you are an expert who is listening to the audio.
Make sure that the questions are complex, and that the detailed answers reflect your expertise as an expert AI assistant that is knowledgeable about music production, musical structure, music history, and music styles listening to the clip.
- You should ask question creatively, diversely.
- Stritly Return a single JSON list object containing the question-answer pairs.

Where 
qa is the conversation, you should genreate ~3 genral question and ~1 functino calling qa
caption is the comprehensive description of the music
beat, chord and key are short descriptions of the music from different perspective. Try to summarize what happend in the music, and list common pattern you find. These captions should be informative.

Eg: 
beat:  there are xx beats in this music, a typical beat sequence is xxxxx, 
caption: the music is xxx, where yyy, the chord is xxx, zzz
chord: This music uses a typical xx chord, where the sequence is a,b,c,d, in the begining of the music yy, the middle aa, then at end bb
key: The tune of the song is A, most of the tune is A, but in the middle of the music it's B, and ....
